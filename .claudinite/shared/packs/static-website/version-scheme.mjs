// The date-anchored version — `<major>.<ymmdd>.<n>`, released as `v…` — is the
// standard's one number, and it is only worth anything if every record of it in
// the repo says the same thing. The bump writes them together (validating all of
// them before writing any); this catches the hand edit that touched one, and the
// version that isn't the scheme at all.
//
// The scheme itself — what ymmdd means, why the year digit is there, how the day
// counter and the decade wrap work — lives with the code that computes it, in
// stubs/actions/bump-site-version/bump.mjs, which is where VERSION_RE and the
// version reader are imported from: one definition, no second copy to drift.
