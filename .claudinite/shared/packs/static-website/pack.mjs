// The static-website standard: a plain static site that releases on push, carries
// a date-anchored version, and serves from GitHub Pages out of an EXPLICIT
// publish set. The pipeline is authored once in this pack's stubs/ and vendored
// into each site repo's own .github/ (GitHub resolves reusable workflows and
// composite actions only from a repo's own .github/), so a repo hosts the
// pipeline without owning it.
//
// Fingerprinted by the orchestrator — a repo declaring the pack for the
// versioning and CI half while its site deploys somewhere other than Pages
// carries none of it, and every rule here is relevance-gated on it, so nothing
// fires on that repo. The declaration is still what activates the pack.
