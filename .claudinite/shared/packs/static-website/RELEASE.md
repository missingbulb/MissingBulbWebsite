# Static website — versioning, release-on-push and Pages publication standard

Every static-site repo of ours ships the **same** pipeline: same workflows, same versioning, same
publish-set rules, same CI gate. This doc is that contract, the setup for a new site repo, and the
one-time GitHub settings the automation cannot turn on for itself.

The workflow **logic** is authored once, in this pack's [`stubs/`](stubs/) — the
[orchestrator](stubs/workflows/static-site-release.yml), two `workflow_call`-only **reusable
workflows** ([publish](stubs/workflows/static-site-publish.yml),
[deploy](stubs/workflows/static-site-deploy-pages.yml)), the
[CI gate](stubs/workflows/static-site-ci.yml), and three composite actions
([read-site-config](stubs/actions/read-site-config/action.yml),
[bump-site-version](stubs/actions/bump-site-version/action.yml),
[assemble-site](stubs/actions/assemble-site/action.yml)) — and **vendored into each site repo's own
`.github/`**, where the whole pipeline runs with no cross-repo dependency. GitHub resolves a
reusable workflow or a composite action only from a repo's own `.github/`, never from the shared
mount, so "the logic lives in the pack" means the pack holds the templates and each repo hosts a
*managed* copy: edit the pack, not the copy. Everything repo-specific is the five keys of
`.github/site.config`, so every vendored file is copy-verbatim across repos.

## The contract

### Versioning — `v<major>.<ymmdd>.<n>`

The site's version is **date-anchored**, and it is computed, never typed. The scheme, and the code
that computes it, live together in [bump.mjs](stubs/actions/bump-site-version/bump.mjs):

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| `major` | the wrap counter. Raised by hand only as a deliberate "new generation of the site" statement — and automatically on the decade wrap (below). |
| `ymmdd` | the **last digit of the UTC year**, then `MM`, then `DD`. 2026-12-31 → `61231`; 2027-01-01 → `70101`. |
| `n` | the day's release counter: `1` for the day's first release, the previous release's `n + 1` for each further release the **same** day. |

**Why the year digit.** The bare `MMDD` form is not monotonic across a year boundary: December
31st's `1.1231.3` sorts *above* the next day's `1.0101.1`, so "later" stopped meaning "bigger" —
which is the one thing every reader of a version assumes. Prefixing the year digit restores it:
`1.61231.3` → `1.70101.1`.

**The decade wrap.** One year digit means 2029-12-31 (`91231`) is followed by 2030-01-01 (`00101`)
— the one legitimate decrease. The major absorbs it: `1.91231.4` → `2.00101.1`, and the ordering
holds forever. Any *other* decrease (a version dated in the future — a hand edit, a wrong clock) is
an error and fails the bump loudly; burning a major to paper over it would hide a real problem.

**Moving an existing site onto the scheme** is a one-line edit, once: rewrite the current version
in place with the year digit inserted (`1.1231.3` → `1.61231.3`). The result is strictly greater
than what it replaces (`61231 > 1231`), so no tag or release ordering is disturbed and no major
bump is needed. Every release after that is the pipeline's.

The version lives in the files the repo names in `version_files` — the first is the source of
truth, the rest must agree. `sw/version-scheme` holds them to the scheme and to each other; the
bump validates every record before writing any, so a failure never leaves a half-bumped tree.

### The published artifact — an explicit list

The Pages artifact is assembled from `publish_paths` under `publish_root`, **and nothing else**.
The rejected alternative is subtractive — "serve the repo except `.claude/` and `.claudinite/`" —
and it fails in the direction that hurts: it publishes every file nobody thought to exclude, and it
publishes each *new* one silently, the day it lands. An additive list can only publish what the
repo asked for, and its failure mode (a file that doesn't appear) is visible on the site and caught
on the PR. Two guards make that concrete, in [assemble-site](stubs/actions/assemble-site/action.yml):
a publish path that doesn't exist fails the run, and so does an assembled site with no `index.html`
at its root. Both also run on every pull request, so a broken publish set never reaches `main`.

### `.github/site.config` — required, five keys, no defaults

A dotenv file, **every key required and explicit**. A default that "happens to match" a repo's
layout silently publishes the wrong tree the day the layout or the default changes:

| Key | What it is |
|---|---|
| `publish_root` | the directory the site is rooted at; `.` = the repo root. It becomes the site's `/`. |
| `publish_paths` | the publish set: space-separated files/directories under `publish_root`. |
| `version_files` | space-separated version records; the first is the source of truth. |
| `build_command` | what produces the publish set; `""` = nothing to build, stated. |
| `test_command` | the repo's gate; `""` = no tests, stated. |

A command that needs dependencies installs them itself (`npm ci && npm test`) — that's why there is
no sixth "setup" key and no assumption that a lockfile exists.

```dotenv
# A hand-authored site with no build step.
publish_root=.
publish_paths=index.html about.html assets data
version_files=package.json
build_command=
test_command=npm ci && npm test
```

`read-site-config` fails the run on a missing file, a missing or empty required key, or an unknown
(typo'd) key; `sw/site-config` fails the same cases in the repo's own checks, plus a publish path
that matches nothing tracked, a tooling directory in the publish set, and a site with no
`index.html`.

### The workflows

**One orchestrator per repo** — [`static-site-release.yml`](stubs/workflows/static-site-release.yml),
named exactly `Release static site`. It owns only the triggers (push to `main`, plus a
`workflow_dispatch` with `force`) and calls the local publish reusable, which runs:

| Stage | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check` | is a release due? A push that touched the publish set, or `force`, or a repo with no release yet. The baseline is the **latest release tag**, not a time window, so a failed run is caught by the next push instead of stranded. |
| `verify` | the repo's `test_command`, on the tree being released — **before** anything is bumped, tagged or deployed. |
| `bump` | the date-anchored version across `version_files`, pushed to `main` as `Release v… [skip ci]`. |
| `release` | GitHub Release `v<major>.<ymmdd>.<n>` at the bump commit, auto-generated notes. |
| `deploy` | the Pages deploy of that exact commit, from the explicit publish set. |
| `report-failure` | any failure above opens a fresh `workflow-failure` issue and closes earlier open ones for this workflow as duplicates, so the newest failure is the single open bug to triage. |

The bump is pushed with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which fires no workflow — which is why the deploy is an
explicit call rather than a second push trigger, and why the push cannot loop.

A push that touches nothing published is a clean no-op: no bump, no tag, no redeploy.

**CI** — [`static-site-ci.yml`](stubs/workflows/static-site-ci.yml) runs on every pull request with
**no `paths:` filter**: the Claudinite world sweep, the repo's `test_command`, the build, and a dry
run of the artifact assembly. The missing path filter is deliberate — a path-filtered conformance
flow arms auto-merge and then never runs, so the repo's own maintenance PR waits forever.

## Setting up a new site repo

1. **Declare** `static-website` in `.claudinite-checks.json` and answer the pack's two adoption
   questions (where it's served; what's published). Re-vendor so the pack's tree lands under the
   shared mount.
2. **Vendor the pipeline** into the repo's own `.github/`: everything under
   [`stubs/workflows/`](stubs/workflows/) and [`stubs/actions/`](stubs/actions/). There are no
   tokens to replace. A repo whose site deploys somewhere **other** than Pages takes the CI stub
   and the versioning half only, and skips the orchestrator + the two reusables — every rule in
   this pack is gated on the orchestrator, so nothing here fires on it.
3. **Write `.github/site.config`** with all five keys, from the adoption answers.
4. **Put the version on the scheme** — one hand edit in each `version_files` record (`1.1231.3` →
   `1.61231.3` for an existing site; `1.<today's ymmdd>.1` for a new one).
5. **Open the one-time settings issue** (below) — idempotent: search the tracker first and skip if
   one already exists, open or closed.
6. Run the world sweep; `sw/release-workflows`, `sw/site-config` and `sw/version-scheme` are the
   checklist for whether the wiring is complete.

## The settings only a human can turn on

Repository settings are not repo content: no workflow, check or agent can set them, and a pipeline
that silently depends on one is a pipeline that fails on its first run for a reason nobody wrote
down. So they are tracked as **state, in one issue in the adopting repo** — done once, then closed
— not as a standing file:

```markdown
### One-time GitHub settings for the static-site release pipeline

The release pipeline is vendored and green in CI, but the following are repository *settings* —
nothing in the repo can set them, so they are turned on by hand (Settings → …). Until they are,
the first release-on-push run fails and opens a `workflow-failure` issue.

- [ ] **Pages → Build and deployment → Source = "GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch").
      Without it `actions/deploy-pages` fails and nothing is served.
- [ ] **Actions → General → Workflow permissions = "Read and write permissions"**, so the pipeline
      can push the version bump and create the release. (Not needed if the repo is already on
      read/write.)
- [ ] **Environments → `github-pages` → deployment branches** must allow `main` — the default
      "protected branches only" rule already does; check it if the repo renamed its default branch.
- [ ] Optional: **Pages → Custom domain**, if this site has one. Note that a custom domain moves
      the site from `/<repo>/` to the domain root — see the relative-URL rule in the pack's
      [RULES.md](RULES.md).

Close this issue once the first release-on-push run has deployed successfully.
```

## Routine work

- **Ship a change**: merge it to `main`. If it touched the publish set, the site redeploys under a
  new `v<major>.<ymmdd>.<n>` on its own — that is the whole release procedure.
- **Redeploy without a content change** (a settings fix, a first deploy): run **Release static
  site** from its dispatch page with `force: true`.
- **"bump version"** on a site repo means the **major** — the deliberate "new generation" statement.
  Edit it in every `version_files` record together, in one PR; the pipeline's next run takes the
  date and the counter from there.
- **A failed release** leaves a `workflow-failure` issue with the run link. The stages are ordered
  so a failure before `bump` changes nothing at all; a failure after it leaves the version bumped
  on `main`, and the next push (or a `force` dispatch) releases from there.
