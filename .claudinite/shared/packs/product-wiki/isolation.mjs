// The wall: nothing outside product-wiki/ may reference the self-growing wiki
// folders; product-wiki/product-requirements is the one reviewed crossing point.
// A CONTRIBUTED barrier: this module is pure data the barriers pack builds into
// the rule (product-wiki `requires` barriers and carries this under
// `contributes` on its manifest — the declaration-and-configuration composition
// pack-independence mandates). This edge and product-wiki-layout are a designed
// pair — the glob target fails closed ("matched no directories", blocking) on an
// empty product-wiki/ expansion, and layout owns the missing-skeleton complaint.
// Under the structural standard a renamed wiki folder is still a wiki folder,
// still barred — no per-folder disarm hole.
//
// Edge notes (each empirically verified against a real consumer tree):
// - to 'product-wiki/*' bars every direct CHILD DIRECTORY of product-wiki/; files
//   directly under product-wiki/ (the index README) stay reachable — a repo's root
//   CLAUDE.md legitimately links product-wiki/README.md.
// - allow keeps the crossing point reachable from every guarded file.
// - except 'product-wiki' unguards the whole product-wiki/ subtree (wikis reference
//   each other, sample-data, and outward freely — the wall is one-directional)
//   and satisfies the root-guard validation for the glob target.
// - except '.claudinite-checks.json': the settings file legitimately spells
//   wiki paths (accept entries, historical config) — configuration is not a
//   dependency.
// - matchUniqueFilenames OFF: wiki/sample-data filenames are agent-written,
//   so leaving the unique-basename layer on would let every distinctive
//   filename the growth routine invents become a repo-wide barred bare name
//   outside the consumer's review. Path references still fire.
// - No baked reviewed-exceptions, and consumers can't add any to a
//   pack-shipped edge — crossingExcuse points each finding at the lever that
//   works (an accept; see packs/product-wiki/README.md). Unlike a rule-owned
//   except, accepts are not staleness-audited — prune them by hand.
