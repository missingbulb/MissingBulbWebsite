// run date (bold or plain — the invariant is dating, not typography), the date
// is a real calendar date, and a seeded page has at least one entry (a page
// with content and an empty log never recorded its seed). Indented
// continuation lines and prose paragraphs are ignored; the bullet/date grammar
// is lib.mjs's, shared with the freshness advisory so the two checks can never
// disagree about what an entry date is. Deliberately absent: ordering (a
// backdated correction is legitimate) and any wall-clock rule (staleness is
// the freshness advisory's job).
