// The staleness nag — ADVISORY by design, never blocking: it is time-driven
// and directional (it goes red with no change to the repo), which must never
// block a Stop or fail CI. It exists because it is the only in-repo observer
// for the real failure mode "the unattended growth channel silently stopped
// firing" — ~6 weekly cycles of silence earns a nag. Per-page (one active wiki
// must not mask starved siblings), gated on mode 'all' (a whole-repo
// assertion; the Stop hook and CI both run 'all', so coverage is unchanged).
//
// Only ENTRY dates count — the leading date of a top-level bullet, lib.mjs's
// DATED grammar shared with the growth-log check — never a date mentioned in
// an entry's body or the section's prose, which would silently reset the
// staleness clock this advisory exists to watch. Entry dates more than 2 days
// in the future are discarded so a typo'd future date can't mark a page fresh
// forever. Silence it with rules: {"product-wiki-freshness": "off"}.
